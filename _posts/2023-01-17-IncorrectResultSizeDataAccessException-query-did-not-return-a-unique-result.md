The `IncorrectResultSizeDataAccessException` with the message "query did not return a unique result" typically indicates that a database query returned more than one result, when a unique result was expected.

To fix this issue, you should modify your query to ensure that it returns a unique result. This can typically be done by adding a `WHERE` clause to the query that specifies a unique identifier for the desired record.

For example, if you are trying to retrieve a user record by email address, you can use a query like this:

```
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?
```

This query will return a unique result if there is only one user with the specified email address, or an exception if there are multiple users with the same email address.

If you are using a `JpaRepository` in your Spring application, you can use the `findOne` method to execute the query and retrieve the unique result. This method will throw an `IncorrectResultSizeDataAccessException` if the query returns more than one result.

```
User user = userRepository.findOne(Example.of(User.builder().email(email).build()));
```

By ensuring that your queries return a unique result, you can avoid the `IncorrectResultSizeDataAccessException` and ensure that your code handles multiple results gracefully.
