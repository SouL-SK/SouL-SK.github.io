The "QuerySyntaxException: table is not mapped" error occurs in the Spring Data JPA framework when you try to execute a query that references an entity or table that is not mapped in the persistence context.

There are several possible causes for this error:

1. The entity or table is not annotated with the `@Entity` annotation: In order for an entity to be mapped in the persistence context, it must be annotated with the `@Entity` annotation. If the entity is not annotated with the `@Entity` annotation, you will get the "QuerySyntaxException: table is not mapped" error when you try to execute a query that references the entity.
2. The entity or table is not registered in the persistence unit: In order for an entity to be mapped in the persistence context, it must be registered in the persistence unit. If the entity is not registered in the persistence unit, you will get the "QuerySyntaxException: table is not mapped" error when you try to execute a query that references the entity.
3. The entity or table name is spelled incorrectly in the query: Make sure that you are spelling the entity or table name correctly in the query. If the name is spelled incorrectly, you will get the "QuerySyntaxException: table is not mapped" error.
4. The entity or table does not exist in the database: Make sure that the entity or table exists in the database. If the entity or table does not exist, you will get the "QuerySyntaxException: table is not mapped" error.

In my case, I was initializing the `@Query` annotation in Repository class. I mapped db table names on it, but correct syntax was mapping class names that annotated by `@Entity` annotation.

```java
@Entity
public class Customer {

  private Long id;
  private String name;
  private Integer age;

  // constructors, getters, and setters
}

@Repository
public interface CustomerRepository extends JpaRepository<Customer, Long> {

  @Query(value = "SELECT * FROM customer WHERE name = :name", nativeQuery = true)
  Customer findByName(@Param("name") String name);

}
```

To fix the "QuerySyntaxException: table is not mapped" error, make sure that the entity or table is annotated with the `@Entity` annotation, registered in the persistence unit, spelled correctly in the query, and exists in the database. If the error persists, make sure that the persistence context is properly configured and that the query syntax is correct.

Overall, the "QuerySyntaxException: table is not mapped" error occurs in the Spring Data JPA framework when you try to execute a query that references an entity or table that is not mapped in the persistence context. To fix this error, make sure that the entity or table is annotated with the `@Entity` annotation, registered in the persistence unit, spelled correctly in the query, and exists in the database.
